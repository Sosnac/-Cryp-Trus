I'm David — a Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH) focused on offensive and defensive security. I blend hands-on penetration testing, vulnerability assessment, and practical defensive controls to help organizations identify, remediate, and harden against threats. I work with tools like Nmap and other security technologies to uncover risks and improve security posture.

## 🚀 About Me
- 🔍 Current focus: Penetration testing, red teaming, and building repeatable security testing workflows.
- 🛡️ Passionate about: Finding real-world vulnerabilities and helping teams implement lasting fixes.
- 💬 Ask me about: offensive security methodologies, defensive best practices, threat modeling, and security tooling.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I enjoy translating attack findings into practical, prioritized remediation plans that engineering teams can act on quickly.

## 🛠️ Top Skills
- Offensive Security (pentesting, exploitation, red teaming)
- Defensive Security (hardening, incident response guidance)
- Security tooling: Nmap, (others you use: e.g., Metasploit, Burp Suite, Wireshark)
- Vulnerability assessment & risk triage
- Security automation and repeatable testing workflows

(If you want these listed as icons/badges I can add them.)

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies
- Scanning & enumeration: Nmap, masscan
- Web assessment: Burp Suite, OWASP ZAP
- Exploitation & scripting: Metasploit, custom Python/Bash scripts
- Logging & detection: ELK/PL, SIEM basics
- Containers & infra: Docker, common cloud security considerations

(Add or remove tools to match your exact toolkit.)

## 🌟 Featured Projects
I don't yet have project details from you. Add 2–4 featured projects (repo URL + one-line description + tech/role + highlight) and I'll convert them into polished project cards here.

Example format you can paste:
- https://github.com/your/repo — IoT pentest toolkit — Tools: Nmap, Python — Highlight: automated discovery reduced triage time by 40%
