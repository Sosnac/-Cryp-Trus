I'm David — a Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH) focused on offensive and defensive security. I blend hands-on penetration testing, vulnerability assessment, and practical defensive controls to help organizations identify, remediate, and harden against threats. I work with tools like Nmap and other security technologies to uncover risks and improve security posture.
